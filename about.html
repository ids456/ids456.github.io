      Many customer undersetsimate importance of A/C maitenance. Proper maintenance ensures that air conditioning 
       system operates at peak efficiency. Clean filters, coils, and other components allow the system to function 
       optimally, reducing energy consumption and ultimately lowering your utility bills.
       On average A/C unit consumes 1.2-6.5 kW per hour of power.
       There is a formula below to calculate amount of money you will have to pay when your A/C is on for an hour.

<h2> kW Cost Calculation Instruction: </h2>
<ol>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
<li>Enter amount of kW your A/C unit consumes every hour</li>
<li>Enter electricity cost (per kW)</li>
<li>Press 'Calculate'</li>
<li>The cost will appear in Popup Box </li>

</ol>



<b> Formula: result = kW * cost </b>
<br /><br />

Enter kW value from A/C's data plate :<br /> <input type="text" id ="watts" / >

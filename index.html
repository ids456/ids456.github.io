        My name is Ilya, and I am an undergraduate student at Southwestern College, Wichita KS. 
         I started my educational journey with SW college back in 2021 and had an outstanding experience.
         I am pursuing a degree in Computer Programming Technology and additionally working on completing all the courses
         for Cybercrime Investigation certificate. Combined knowledge of programing and cybersecurity is vital and beneficial due to 
         both fields heavily relying on one another.
